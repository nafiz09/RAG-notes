A retriever finds useful documents from a knowledge base so the LLM can answer a question.

- This sounds simple, but it's actually hard because:

- Users talk in normal language, not clear search queries.

- The stored documents can be emails, memos, reports, or articles.

- These documents are written for humans, not computers.

- The retriever must search lots of messy text fast and return the most relevant parts within seconds.

Retrievers use different search techniques to match user questions with the right information.
Each method has strengths and weaknesses, and good retrievers often combine multiple methods for the best results.
